# Training with MyVision Oxfordshire

Last week, I was delighted to join Nathan Tree from MyVision Oxfordshire to deliver a full day of training to Connection Support on Disability Awareness and Inclusion. Nathan delivered a fantastic Visual Awareness training session as part of his role at MyVision Oxfordshire. After this, I then delivered my first ever Physical Disability Awareness training. I have written this training and it is based on real, lived experience. We then delivered a joint presentation called 'The Emotional Impact of Disability' which we have written together and again has lived experience at it's heart. It felt really good to deliver my first ever presentation and there is lots of learning I can take from this.

Nathan and I are incredibly passionate about true inclusion, and hearing this from real, genuine lived experience. We recognise the importance of creating a safe space, where people feel able to share experiences and ask questions as well as acknowledging the fact that we all make mistakes and it is ensuring we learn from these.

I have been working on this venture for two years now and feel I am at a point where I am ready to give this a go. I will be working as 3DOM and Inclusion and will be looking to work with organisations and businesses in Oxfordshire to deliver my training and support them on their journey to being truly inclusive. Whilst I don't have the professional knowledge, I have real, lived experience and share my experiences to highlight how far we have come, but also how far we still have to go to becoming truly inclusive. I will also be looking to develop consultancy and facilitation work in due course, as well as launching my website.

Nathan and myself are happy to chat about delivering joint training sessions so if you think this may be of interest to you please get in touch at hello@3inc.co.uk

I have so many people to thank for supporting me, encouraging me and challenging me to get to this point, and whilst I am just at the beginning of this journey, I feel it is important to acknowledge where I have come from to get to this point and to thank everyone for whom without, this would not have been possible. These include Nathan Tree Jenny Hinde Kate Dean Ted Smith Atif Choudhury Melanie Francis Chartered FCIPD Mark Lygo Hatch Enterprise UK and many more. Thank you.

Please do get in touch with Nathan and myself, and I would highly recommend connecting with MyVision Oxfordshire regarding their Visual Awareness training. Having both observed and participated, it really is a fantastic training.
