# MyVision Partnership

Thank you so much to the awesome team MyVision Oxfordshire for being so engaging at our Physical Disability Awareness Training session today, it was great to hear your thoughts, perspectives and fantastic questions. It is always so inspiring to be in a room where people are so incredibly passionate about true inclusion and real, lived experience.
I am so privileged to be able to work with many of you through various pieces of work and it was equally a privilege to meet the rest of the team. I look forward to continuing our work together.

Nathan Tree MyVision Oxfordshire and myself will be working in partnership to deliver a package of trainings including:

- Visual Impairment Awareness training
- Physical Disability Awareness training
- The emotional impact of Disability

We also have more planned and can tailor the training. If you are interested in learning more about the training, please do get in touch via hello@3inc.co.uk or with Nathan Tree and we are very happy to discuss this further.

Thank you MyVision Oxfordshire
