    <p class="mb-4">I offer 'Physical Disability Awareness training' through the lens of real, lived experience. This training has been created to support organisations and businesses on their journey to becoming truly inclusive of those who are physically disabled. It also creates the opportunity to start thinking more broadly about what being truly inclusive means and how this can support other types of disability as well as other protected characterises. Interactive and honest, this training can be tailored to meet the needs of your organisation and can be delivered on its own or a part of a wider training package. If you would like to find out more, <a href="/contact/">please get in touch</a>.</p>
