    <p class="mb-4">3DOM and Inclusion is being developed because I passionately believe in inclusion for all. I believe that for individuals, businesses and educational settings to be able to be truly inclusive, there needs to be a collective responsibility by everyone to embed Equity, Diversity and Inclusion into everything. Inclusion should be something we all acknowledge naturally, as opposed to something that is separate or extra in our everyday life.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We facilitate conversations which enable people to truly reflect on what the word 'inclusion' means and what it looks like within a given setting. We believe that by giving people the opportunity to share their thoughts in a safe, secure environment, will allow for open conversations and the opportunity to explore ways to be truly inclusive. </p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our <strong>vision</strong> is to support in creating a world which is inclusive of everyone. We believe that one of the most important ways of doing this is through hearing real, lived experience and being able to learn from one another.  </p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our <strong>mission</strong> is to support individuals, businesses and educational settings to explore ways as to how they can play their part in ensuring we live in a truly inclusive society. </p>
    <p class="mb-4">We facilitate conversations which enable people to truly reflect on what the word 'inclusion' means and what it looks like within a given setting. We believe that by giving people the opportunity to share their thoughts in a safe, secure environment, will allow for open conversations and the opportunity to explore ways to be truly inclusive. </p>
    <p class="mb-4">The <strong>values</strong> of 3DOM and Inclusion are:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
        <li>To facilitate conversations and presentations, based on real, lived experiences, to explore how we all have a part to play in creating a truly inclusive society.</li>
        <li>To break down barriers and promote inclusion, in a way which enables everyone to have a voice and feel listened too.</li>
        <li>To explore different approaches and to acknowledge that there is no 'one size fits all' approach.</li>
        <li>To create a safe environment and to be respectful of all points of view and experiences. </li>
        <li>We believe that a truly inclusive society is of benefit to everyone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-4">Here, at 3DOM and Inclusion, we want to fully demonstrate the positive difference to everyone, when individuals can participate in a truly inclusive environment and inclusion is at the very heart. We also want to show, through authentic, relatable experiences, and positive facilitation, the deep, long-lasting impact exclusion and inclusion can have on individuals.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We recognise that sometimes people can feel uncomfortable with the idea of inclusion, not because they disagree with it, but because they have not had the opportunity to explore what it means in practice. We believe by educating through lived experience, and open conversation, we can support them on their journey.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">My own lived experience has enabled me to gain an understanding of what exclusion feels like but also what inclusion feels like and I hope that by using this, as well as more broader experiences, to support others in understanding the importance of being truly inclusive and to support ways in making this happen.</p>
